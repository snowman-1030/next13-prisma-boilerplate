## What are we building ? üèóÔ∏è

We are building an open source status uptime monitoring with a beautiful status
page. Our goal is to provide a fast service to our users.

To achieve this, we are hosting it on the Vercel Edge Runtime, which requires an
Edge Database to fully benefit from it.

We also aim to simplify contributions to our project by eliminating the
requirement for an account on an external service.

Our current data tech stack is:

- [Next 13](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
- [Tinybird](https://www.tinybird.co/)
- [Turso](https://turso.tech/)

### What is PlanetScale ? üóÉÔ∏è

[PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) is a cloud-native database platform.

It is built on top of the open-source database system Vitess. PlanetScale offers
a managed database service that allows developers to deploy, manage, and scale
databases easily. In my opinion, the standout feature of PlanetScale is its
migration management system.

### What is Turso ? üåç

[Turso](https://turso.tech/) is a new database provider.

They provide an edge database that enhances the developer experience of SQLite
for your users. It enables extensive replication, allowing you to distribute
your data to numerous locations where your users are located.

### History of the project üìú

When we began the project, we opted for PlanetScale due to its simplicity and
cost-free database option. They also don't have any cold start which is super
nice for us. Since we wanted to build fast, it was a good choice when we started
the project. The database was just a URL. Their migration tools, ensuring zero
downtime, were also valuable to us during rapid prototyping and frequent
modifications.

I came across Turso on X (formely known as Twitter) and became interested in
trying it out. It seems promising as their value proposition is an edge
database, which is exactly what we need. We plan to deploy the status page to
the edge (Vercel Edge Runtime). Calling a database in a specific region would
negate the benefits of Vercel Edge Runtime.

## What drove our changes ? ü§î

### Performance üèéÔ∏è

Not all of our users are in `us-east-1`. Users who are not located in
`us-east-1` should receive the same level of performance as those in that
region.

I was playing with this [Vercel tool](https://edge-data-latency.vercel.app/) to
determine the most suitable database for our users. Among the options, Turso
proved to be the fastest.

![Turso latency](/assets/posts/migration-planetscale-to-turso/turso-latency.png)
Turso is around `60ms` for 5 serial queries globally.
![PlanetScale latency](/assets/posts/migration-planetscale-to-turso/planetscale-latency.png)
While PlanetScale is around `450ms` for 5 serial queries in a different region.

We considered using read replicas from PlanetScale, but I was also interested in
trying out Turso.

With Turso, you only need a single URL for all your replicas, eliminating the
need to add this logic in your codebase. Additionally, Turso's scaler plan is
more affordable, offering 6 replicas for $29, whereas PlanetScale only allows 3
replicas.

Turso offers 26 regions, while PlanetScale only offers 11 regions (their AWS
regions).

### Better DX for contributors üßë‚Äçüíª

We are building an open source status page, and we want to make it easy for
everyone to contribute to it.

Asking our users to create an account on a new service is a bit awkward. We
could have asked for our user to use Docker and create a MySQL8 database while
developing locally. However I don‚Äôt like Docker, it consumes too much memory on
my laptop üòÅ.

Or we use a file and SQLite, as it is the best option for everyone. And it‚Äôs
what we can achieve with Turso: seamless local development.

## How the migration went. üöÄ

### SQLite has less a less powerful type system than MySQL. üì¶

The migration process from MySQL to SQLite requires some changes. SQLite has
fewer data types compared to MySQL. For example, DateTime doesn't exist in
SQLite, so dates should be treated as integers.

There are only five types in SQLite:

- `INT`
- `INTEGER`
- `REAL`
- `TEXT`
- `BLOB`

We use Drizzle for type handling and migration in our codebase, so we weren't
significantly affected by this. Additionally, our experience with SQLite has
taught us the importance of implementing additional checks in our code, rather
than solely relying on the database engine.

### Drizzle ORM Migration üò±

We had to write additional SQL for migration when transitioning from Planetscale
and/or Prisma. Initially, it was a bit frustrating because Drizzle could not
generate all the necessary migration code.

```
/*
 SQLite does not support "Drop not null from column" out of the box,
 we do not generate automatic migration for that, so it has to be done manually
 Please refer to: <https://www.techonthenet.com/sqlite/tables/alter_table.php>
                  <https://www.sqlite.org/lang_altertable.html>
                  <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2083543/modify-a-columns-type-in-sqlite3>

 Due to that we don't generate migration automatically
 and it has to be done manually
*/

```

After migrating a couple of times, you realize that they are mostly the same,
and you need to follow these steps.

1. Create new table
2. Copy data into new table
3. Drop old table
4. Rename new table

As it can been seen in this
[migration](https://github.com/openstatusHQ/openstatus/blob/9f610d7cafb892774ceda533b3f21aaa4a4b3d5f/packages/db/drizzle/0003_glamorous_living_mummy.sql)
when we released the incident:

```sql
ALTER TABLE `incident` RENAME TO `incident_old`;--> statement-breakpoint
ALTER TABLE `incident_update` RENAME TO `incident_update_old`;--> statement-breakpoint

DROP TABLE `incident_old`;--> statement-breakpoint
DROP TABLE `incident_update_old`;--> statement-breakpoint

CREATE TABLE `incident` (
`id` integer PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
`status` text(4) NOT NULL,
`title` text(256) NOT NULL,
`created_at` integer DEFAULT (strftime('%s', 'now')),
`updated_at` integer DEFAULT (strftime('%s', 'now')),
`workspace_id` integer NOT NULL,
FOREIGN KEY (`workspace_id`) REFERENCES `workspace`(`id`) ON UPDATE no action ON DELETE cascade
);
--> statement-breakpoint

CREATE TABLE `incident_update` (
`id` integer PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
`status` text(4) NOT NULL,
`date` integer NOT NULL,
`message` text NOT NULL,
`created_at` integer DEFAULT (strftime('%s', 'now')),
`updated_at` integer DEFAULT (strftime('%s', 'now')),
`incident_id` integer NOT NULL,
FOREIGN KEY (`incident_id`) REFERENCES `incident`(`id`) ON UPDATE no action ON DELETE cascade
);
--> statement-breakpoint

```

## The Turso Doc üìö

The Turso Documentation has been the major challenge during the migration. We
faced difficulties finding the specific information. We needed to make it work
both locally and on Turso.

However, we have DMed [Glauber Costa](https://twitter.com/glcst), the CEO of
Turso, and they are aware of this issue. Hopefully, they will update the
documentation soon. We believe that with comprehensive documentation and plenty
of examples, Turso will be an even greater product.

## The verdict üçæ

We are pleased with the change, regardless of whether our users are interested
in the stack we use. We genuinely enjoy using this stack. Turso is still an
early product, but we are confident that it will improve over time. I strongly
believe in its future.

P.S. We are building OpenStatus in public, follow
[me](https://www.twitter.com/thibaultleouay) or
[Max](https://www.twitter.com/mxkaske) on Twitter/X if you want sneak peaks of
the upcoming features - it's fun to watch! üçø
