Understanding two important concepts in JavaScript: hoisting and promises.

## Understanding Hoisting and Promises in JavaScript

JavaScript is a versatile programming language that offers a wide range of
features and functionalities. Two important concepts to grasp in JavaScript are
hoisting and promises. Understanding these concepts can greatly enhance your
ability to write efficient and reliable code. In this blog post, we will explore
what hoisting and promises are, how they work, and provide some code examples to
illustrate their usage.

## Hoisting: Bringing Declarations to the Top

Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations
are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase.
This means that you can access and use variables and functions before they are
actually declared in your code. However, it's important to note that only the
declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.

For example, consider the following code snippet:

```js title="index.js" {} showLineNumbers
console.log(name);
```

## Promises: Managing Asynchronous Operations

Promises are a powerful concept introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) that enable
better management of asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They provide a
cleaner and more structured approach to handling asynchronous tasks, such as
network requests or file operations. A promise represents a value that may not
be available yet, but will be resolved at some point in the future.

Promises have three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. When a promise is
pending, it means the asynchronous operation is still in progress. Once the
operation is completed successfully, the promise is fulfilled and returns a
value. On the other hand, if an error occurs during the operation, the promise
is rejected, and an error object is returned.

This code fetches data asynchronously using a promise in TypeScript, resolves
the data after a delay, and handles the received data or any potential errors
using then and catch blocks.

```ts title="index.ts" {3, 16} showLineNumbers
function getData(): Promise<string[]> {
  return new Promise<string[]>((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data: string[] = ["John", "Jane", "Bob"];
      if (data.length > 0) {
        resolve(data);
      } else {
        reject(new Error("No data available."));
      }
    }, 2000);
  });
}

getData()
  .then((data) => {
    console.log("Received data:", data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error:", error.message);
  });
```

## Advantages of Using Promises

- Promises improve code readability and maintainability in JavaScript.
- Promises simplify error handling in asynchronous code.
- Promises help avoid <strong>"callback hell"</strong> by providing a more
  linear and sequential approach to asynchronous operations.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, hoisting and promises are important concepts in JavaScript that
greatly contribute to writing efficient and reliable code. Hoisting allows
variable and function declarations to be moved to the top of their scope,
enabling early access to these entities. Promises, on the other hand, provide a
structured and readable approach to managing asynchronous operations, enhancing
code maintainability and error handling.
