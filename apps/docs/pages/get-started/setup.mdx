Follow these steps for setup:

### **Clone the repository**

To get started, clone the OpenStatus repository by running the following command
in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openstatusHQ/openstatus.git
```

### **Install dependencies**

Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the `openstatus` directory using the
command:

```bash
cd openstatus
```

Next, use pnpm to install the required dependencies. Execute the following
command:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### **Configure .env files**

To configure the application, you need to set certain environment variables in a
`.env` file. You will find an example file named `.env.example` in the
`apps/web` and `packages/db` directories. Copy this file and rename it to
`.env`. Then, edit the `.env` file with specific values required for your
configuration.

You can use any text editor, or manually copy it into an empty .env file or
whatever you want to do.

For example, you can use a text editor (nano) to open the `.env` file:

```bash
# apps/web
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
nano apps/web/.env

# packages/db
cp packages/db/.env.example packages/db/.env
nano packages/db/.env
```

Make sure to provide appropriate values for each variable defined in the `.env`
file. These variables may include configurations related to the database, API
credentials, etc.

Keep in mind that the `.env` file should be kept private and should not be
shared publicly as it may contain sensitive information such as passwords or
access keys.

Once you have completed these steps, you will have finished the setup and
configuration of OpenStatus, and you'll be ready to start the application.
