To begin with, you need to consider the following prerequisites with minimum
versions of certain applications (in addition to Node.js and pnpm which were
already mentioned earlier):

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- pnpm >= 8.6.2

## **Installing Node.js**

To install Node.js, follow the instructions based on your operating system:

- For Windows or macOS, visit the official Node.js website:
  [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) and download the latest or LTS
  version (18.0.0 or above). Run the installer and follow the setup wizard.

- For Linux, you can use a package manager
  ([nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm.git/)) or download the binaries from the
  official Node.js website. For example, using the package manager `apt` on
  Ubuntu:

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install nodejs
  ```

  Ensure that the installed version is 18.0.0 or above:

  ```bash
  node --version
  ```

## **Installing pnpm**

To install pnpm, you can use npm, the Node.js package manager. Open your
terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Make sure that the installed version of pnpm is 8.6.2 or above:

```bash
pnpm --version
```

Alternatively you can also install it from its official website
[https://pnpm.io/](https://pnpm.io/).

## **Optional Requirements for a Local Database:**

If you want to use a local database, it is recommended to install "brew" and
"sqld".

### **Installing brew**

To install brew, it is recommended to use brew.sh from
[https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/) and follow its instructions.

### **Installing sqld**

Once you have installed it and performed updates with brew update --auto-update,
you can install "sqld" as follows:

```bash
brew tap libsql/sqld
brew install sqld-beta
sqld --help
```

This will allow you to work with the local database without modifying the ".env"
file.

Please note that these optional requirements are only necessary if you want to
use a local database. Otherwise, you can continue with the rest of the
configuration as mentioned previously.
