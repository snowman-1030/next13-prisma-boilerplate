## What is Open Status?

OpenStatus is an open source alternative to your current monitoring service with
a beautiful status page.

## Getting Started

There are three ways to get started with OpenStatus.

- Cloud: the fastest and easiest way to try the app (it's free)
- Local: if you're a developer and would like to experiment or contribute to the
  app
- Self-hosting: if you want greater control over your data and want to run the
  app on your own server

## Contribution

We love contribution, if you see any typo or have any suggestion, please feel to
